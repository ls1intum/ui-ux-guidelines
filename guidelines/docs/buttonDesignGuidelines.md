# Button Guidelines

These guidelines define how buttons should look, behave, and be implemented across all products. 
The goal is to ensure a **consistent, accessible, and intuitive** user experience while maintaining **flexibility and scalability**.


## âœ… TL;DR

- Use the correct variant for every button
- Only **one primary button per page**
- Destructive buttons always open a confirmation
- Use spacing and corner radius consistently
- Icon buttons must be circular and have labels
- Donâ€™t use links for actions or buttons for navigation
- Avoid visual overload â€“ use menus for secondary actions
