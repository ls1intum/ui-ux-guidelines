# üéØ Why do we need guidelines?

- üß≠ **Easier Navigation** ‚Äì Users can quickly find what they need without confusion.
- üîç **Instant Recognition** ‚Äì A consistent design helps users immediately recognize they are on an AET platform.
- ‚ö° **Improved Efficiency** ‚Äì Familiar layouts and interactions reduce cognitive load, making tasks faster and more intuitive.
- üéØ **Professional & Trustworthy** ‚Äì A polished, cohesive UI reinforces credibility and trust in our applications.
- üì± **Seamless Multi-App Experience** ‚Äì Users moving between AET apps experience a unified interface, reducing friction.

By following these guidelines, we create a **seamless and enjoyable experience** for all users. üöÄ

## Purpose
These guidelines introduce the **core principles of good user interface (UI)** and **user experience (UX)** design for web applications.  
They are meant as **mandatory reading** for all project members designing or implementing user-facing features.

## Core Principles

### 1. Simplicity
- Focus on clarity and purpose ‚Äî every element must justify its existence.
- Avoid clutter, technical jargon, and redundant actions.

- [Google's Material Design Principles](https://m3.material.io/foundations/principles/overview)

### 2. Consistency
- Use uniform colors, spacing, icons, and component behavior.
- Follow a **design system** (Material, Bootstrap, or your own).

**References:**
- [Nielsen Norman Group: Consistency and Standards](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/consistency-and-standards/)

### 3. Feedback
- Every user action should produce visible system feedback (loading, confirmation, error).
- Use progress indicators and clear status messages.

**Example:**
- [UX Planet: Feedback in UX Design](https://uxplanet.org/the-importance-of-feedback-in-ui-design-25cc7e0a09d7)

### 4. Accessibility
- Ensure usability for people with disabilities (contrast, keyboard navigation, ARIA labels).

**Resources:**
- [W3C Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/)
- [WebAIM Color Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/)

### 5. Learnability & Affordance
- Users should immediately understand how to use an interface.
- Make clickable elements look clickable.

## Layout & Interaction Basics

| Aspect | Good Practice | Example |
|--------|----------------|----------|
| **Navigation** | Keep menus short and visible; highlight current location | [GOV.UK Design System: Navigation](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/header/) |
| **Forms** | Group related inputs, show inline validation, avoid long forms | [Baymard Institute: Form Design Best Practices](https://baymard.com/blog/forms) |
| **Buttons** | Use consistent styles for primary/secondary actions | [Material Design Buttons](https://m3.material.io/components/buttons/overview) |
| **Error Handling** | Explain what went wrong and how to fix it | [UX Design.cc: Error Message Design](https://uxdesign.cc/design-better-error-messages-9bfb04e9f6d5) |
| **Responsive Design** | Test across devices and screen sizes | [Google: Responsive Design Basics](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/design-and-ux/responsive) |
