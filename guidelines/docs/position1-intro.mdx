# 🎯 Why do we need guidelines?

- 🧭 **Easier Navigation** – Users can quickly find what they need without confusion.
- 🔍 **Instant Recognition** – A consistent design helps users immediately recognize they are on an AET platform.
- ⚡ **Improved Efficiency** – Familiar layouts and interactions reduce cognitive load, making tasks faster and more intuitive.
- 🎯 **Professional & Trustworthy** – A polished, cohesive UI reinforces credibility and trust in our applications.
- 📱 **Seamless Multi-App Experience** – Users moving between AET apps experience a unified interface, reducing friction.

By following these guidelines, we create a **seamless and enjoyable experience** for all users. 🚀

<Callout variant={CalloutVariant.warning}>
    These guidelines introduce the **core principles of good user interface (UI)** and **user experience (UX)** design for web applications.
    They are meant as **mandatory reading** for all project members designing or implementing user-facing features.
</Callout>

## Core Principles

### 1. Simplicity
- Focus on clarity and purpose — every element must justify its existence.
- Avoid clutter, technical jargon, and redundant actions.

**References:**
- [Don't Make Me Think (Summary) – Steve Krug](https://readingraphics.com/book-summary-dont-make-me-think/)

### 2. Consistency
- Use uniform colors, spacing, icons, and component behavior.
  - See the [spacing guidelines](/docs/spacing)
  - See the [color guidelines](/docs/colors)
- Follow a **design system** (Material, Bootstrap, or your own).

- [Nielsen Norman Group: Consistency and Standards](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/consistency-and-standards/)

### 3. Feedback
- Every user action should produce visible system feedback (loading, confirmation, error).
- Use progress indicators and clear status messages.

### 4. Accessibility
Ensure usability for people with disabilities (contrast, keyboard navigation, ARIA labels).

For more details refer to the [accessibility guidelines](/docs/accessibility).

### 5. Learnability & Affordance
- Users should immediately understand how to use an interface.
- Make clickable elements look clickable.

| **Navigation**        | Keep menus short and visible; highlight current location | [GOV.UK Design System: Navigation](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/header/)                 |
| **Buttons**           | Use consistent styles for primary/secondary actions      | [Material Design Buttons](https://m3.material.io/components/buttons/overview)                               |
| **Responsive Design** | Test across devices and screen sizes                     | [Google: Responsive Design Basics](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/design-and-ux/responsive) |
